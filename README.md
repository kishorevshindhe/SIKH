## Branching Strategy

```
main        ← Stable, production-ready code only. No direct pushes.
dev         ← Integration branch. All features merge here first.
feature/backend   ← Member 1
feature/ai        ← Member 2
feature/frontend  ← Member 3
```

### Daily Git Workflow

```bash
# 1. Always start by pulling the latest dev
git pull origin dev

# 2. Switch to your own branch
git checkout feature/your-branch

# 3. Work on your module...

# 4. Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: short description of what you did"

# 5. Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-branch

# 6. When feature is complete → open a Pull Request into dev
```

### Commit Message Prefixes

| Prefix | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `feat:` | New feature |
| `fix:` | Bug fix |
| `docs:` | Documentation |
| `style:` | UI/CSS only |
| `refactor:` | Code cleanup (no feature change) |
| `test:` | Adding/updating tests |
