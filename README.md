## Branching Strategy

```
main        ← Stable, production-ready code only. No direct pushes.
dev         ← Integration branch. All features merge here first.
feature/backend   ← Member 1
feature/ai        ← Member 2
feature/frontend  ← Member 3
```

### Daily Git Workflow

```bash
# 1. Always start by pulling the latest dev
git pull origin dev

# 2. Switch to your own branch
git checkout feature/your-branch

# 3. Work on your module...

# 4. Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: short description of what you did"

# 5. Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-branch

# 6. When feature is complete → open a Pull Request into dev
```

### Commit Message Prefixes

| Prefix | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `feat:` | New feature |
| `fix:` | Bug fix |
| `docs:` | Documentation |
| `style:` | UI/CSS only |
| `refactor:` | Code cleanup (no feature change) |
| `test:` | Adding/updating tests |

## Getting Started

### Backend (Member 1)
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Frontend (Member 3)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### AI Module (Member 2)
```bash
cd ai_module
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Add your API key to .env (never commit this!)
```

---

## Environment Variables

Each member should create a `.env` file in their module directory. **Never commit `.env` files.**

```env
# backend/.env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/sikh_db
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# ai_module/.env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

## Development Phases

| Phase | Title | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Planning & Design |  Done |
| 2 | Backend Development |  In Progress |
| 3 | Search Engine |  Pending |
| 4 | AI Integration | Done |
| 5 | Community System | Done |
| 6 | Security | ⏳ Pending |
| 7 | Integration & Testing | ⏳ Pending |
| 8 | Deployment | ⏳ Pending |

## Rules

- ❌ **Never push directly to `main`**
- ❌ **Never commit `.env` files or API keys**
- ✅ Always pull from `dev` before starting work
- ✅ Use descriptive commit messages with the correct prefix
- ✅ Open a Pull Request when your feature is ready — don't merge yourself
